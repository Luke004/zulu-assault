    <title>How to add a custom map</title>
</head>

<body>

    <p> Create your custom map using the folloing properties in a map editor program called <b>Tiled</b> <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html">(Official Download Link)</a>.
	When you are finished with the map, put the created *.tmx-file in this folder <b>('/assets/maps_custom')</b>.</p>

    <img src="../../assets/help/help_custom_maps.png" alt="Tiled custom map properties">

    <p>The tileset you will need to create a map in Tiled is called <b>'landscape_tiles.png'</b> and can be found in this project under <b>'assets/tilesets'</b>.</p>

    <p>After map creation, you can then open your created *.tmx-file in the Level Editor in game and place all your game objects (entities, items, circles).</p>

    <p>Thanks for playing and enjoy your custom maps :)</p>
